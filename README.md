# TributePage

## Objective

Build a tribute page that is functionally similar to the [FreeCodeCamp Tribute Page Demo](https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks).  
**Do not copy** the demo â€” create your own version with unique content and styling.

---

## Requirements (User Stories)

Your tribute page must include the following elements:

### Structure & Layout

- A `main` element with `id="main"` that contains all other elements on the page.

### Title

- An element with `id="title"` that contains a text string describing the subject (e.g., `"Dr. Norman Borlaug"`).

### Image Section

- A `figure` or `div` element with `id="img-div"`.
- Inside `#img-div`, include:
  - An `img` element with `id="image"` pointing to an image relevant to the subject.
  - An element with `id="img-caption"` that provides a text description of the image.

### Tribute Information

- An element with `id="tribute-info"` that contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.

### External Link

- An anchor tag `<a>` with:
  - `id="tribute-link"`
  - An external link to more info about the subject
  - The attribute `target="_blank"` so the link opens in a new tab

## Image Styling

Your image (`#image`) should:

- Be responsive using `max-width` and `height` properties.
- Be centered within its parent element.
